# Node Module Example

# Try Me!
- `npm run demonstrateNodeInvocation`
- `npm run demonstrateRequire`


- Q. Why does this exist?
- A. Because I can never quite remember the whole `module.exports` thing, and you can only re-read the same chunk of documentation over-and-over again before you're like, _I should probably write this down..._


- Q. Which concept(s) does this illustrate?
- A. Concept(s):
    - How to tell if the context is `node /path/to/node/someJavascript.js`?
    - How to tell if the context is `require('/path/to/node/someJavascript.js')`?


- Q. What's the deal with the license?
- A. Honestly, I do not know. This is meant to be a reference implementation of a core concept.

    - Q. Why?
    - A. I figured the Mozilla Developer Network Documentation (MDN) was a touchpoint for the content. [Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) - Copyrights and Licenses](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/About#Copyrights_and_licenses)
